      "content": "The authentication process in the `tabnam-inc/onboardme` repository is managed using NextAuth, a popular authentication solution for Next.js applications. Here's a breakdown of how authentication is implemented and works within this codebase:\n\n### Configuration (`/src/options.ts`)\n- **Providers**: Authentication providers are configured in the `authOptions` object. The codebase includes configurations for GitHub and WorkOS as authentication providers. AzureADProvider is commented out but also included in the configuration.\n- **Session & JWT**: The session management strategy is set to JWT (JSON Web Tokens), indicating that sessions will be handled through JWT tokens.\n- **Callbacks**: The `session` callback is defined to enrich the session object with additional properties like `tokens`, `membership`, `business`, `checkoutSession`, `freeTrialDaysRemaining`, and `authProvider`.\n\n### Authentication API Route (`/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`)\n- **Handler**: The main handler for authentication uses the NextAuth function, passing the `authOptions` along with additional configurations and callbacks.\n- **Callbacks**: The JWT callback is particularly important as it handles the logic for registering user logins, updating user information, and managing referral programs. It interacts with AWS DynamoDB to check if a user exists, updates their membership status, and handles referral bonuses.\n- **Referral Program**: The code includes logic for handling referrals, such as giving a free month to the referrer if certain conditions are met.\n- **Token Management**: External tokens (e.g., from Azure) are managed and stored securely. The code includes logic for saving these tokens to the database and redacting sensitive information before storage.\n\n### Client-Side Usage\n- **Menu Component (`/src/components/Menu.tsx`)**: This component shows how the authentication state is used to display user-specific information and options. It includes logic for signing in, signing out, and managing the user's session.\n- **Usage of Hooks**: The codebase uses Next.js hooks like `useSession` to manage and access the authentication state throughout the application.\n\n### Summary\nAuthentication in this codebase is centered around NextAuth, leveraging its flexibility to configure multiple providers and manage sessions via JWT. The custom logic in the API route handler extends the basic functionality to include features like a referral program and secure token management. Client-side components interact with the authentication state to provide a personalized user experience."
